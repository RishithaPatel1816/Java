# Java
This repository contains basic Java programs and examples intended for beginners transitioning from C++ or starting with Java.

- Every java program should have atleast one **public class** and name of the class should match with file name.
- Every application will have a main method and syntax for that is below
```Java
public class HelloWorld{
  public static void main(String[] args{
    System.out.println("Hello World!);
  }
}
```
